# ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ Nigeria Election Data
Open Community to collaborate on the published official INEC results collated at elections organised in Nigeria. Now, you can now build your apps and intelligence based on data with a higher level of accuracy.

The goal is to:
- improve voter education
- provide visibility and insights into election process
- provide transparency in the electoral process
- improve the trust of the voters in the electoral process
- encourage participation in good governance
- hold electors accountable
- encourage tech innovation in elections and governance

Please note:::
In Nigeria, only the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has the power to declare a candidate winner of an election organised by INEC.
So when using this data, do well to steer clear from announcing unofficial results.
